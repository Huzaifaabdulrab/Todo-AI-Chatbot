## Task Generation Requirements
- [x] Tasks organized by user story in priority order (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- [x] Each task follows checklist format (- [ ] T### [US#] Description with file path)
- [x] Tasks are in dependency order (Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish)
- [x] Each user story has independent test criteria
- [x] Files paths are specific and accurate
- [x] Parallelizable tasks marked with [P] flag
- [x] Total task count: 39 tasks
- [x] Task count per user story: US1(7 tasks), US2(6 tasks), US3(6 tasks), US4(6 tasks)
- [x] Dependencies section included showing story completion order
- [x] Parallel execution examples provided
- [x] Implementation strategy section with MVP scope
- [x] Format validation passed (all tasks follow checklist format)

## Task Completeness Verification
- [x] US1 (Create Tasks via Chat) has all needed tasks (endpoint fix, task creation, verification)
- [x] US2 (Read/List Tasks) has all needed tasks (list functionality, display, verification)
- [x] US3 (Update/Edit Tasks) has all needed tasks (update functionality, handling, verification)
- [x] US4 (Delete Tasks) has all needed tasks (delete functionality, handling, verification)

- [x] Polish tasks verify end-to-end functionality

## Implementation Readiness
- [x] Tasks are specific enough for LLM execution
- [x] Each task has clear title, file path, and change description
- [x] Testing/verification steps included for each task
- [x] Priority order follows: endpoint mismatch → create → read → update → delete → verification
- [x] MVP scope clearly defined (tasks T004, T008-T012, T013)
